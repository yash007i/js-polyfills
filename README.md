What is mean of Polyfills?
A polyfill is a piece of code (usually JavaScript) that adds missing functionality to older browsers that do not support certain modern features of the JavaScript language or web APIs.
A polyfill is an implementation of a web platform feature that websites can use in browsers that do not natively support the feature.
Polyfills enable web developers to write a single codebase targeting multiple browsers and browser versions, even when some of those browsers don't support some of the features used.

üí° Why Polyfills are Useful
Modern JavaScript (ES6+) has introduced many features ‚Äî like Promise, Array.prototype.includes(), fetch(), etc. ‚Äî that older browsers like Internet Explorer do not understand.
A polyfill allows you to:
Use modern JS features without breaking in older browsers.
Write cleaner code without worrying about backward compatibility.
Improve user experience across all browsers.

üõ†Ô∏è How Does a Polyfill Work?
A polyfill checks if the feature exists, and if not, it defines it:
if (!Array.prototype.includes) {
  Array.prototype.includes = function(value, index) {
    // custom logic to simulate includes()
  };
}

This is only for knowledge purpose.
